## Installation

### Basic Setup for a new Grav site

The simplest way to install Prickly Pear theme for Grav is to download and install the Prickly Pear Skeleton package:

* Download [Prickly Pear Skeleton](http://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons#extras)
* Simply unzip the package into your web root folder.
* Point your browser at the folder, job done!

> TIP: Check out the general [Grav installation instructions](http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) for more details on this process.

### Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the Prickly Pear theme's supported templates. It is strongly advised to at least install the Prickly Pear Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install **just** the theme:

<code>$ bin/gpm install pricklypear</code>

>> NOTE: This theme is a modular component for Grav which requires the [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav), [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) plugins.

<!--#### Contact Form Configuration
For contact form configuration instructions please refer to [official documentation](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/contact-form). Make sure you installed Email and Form plugin though.-->
